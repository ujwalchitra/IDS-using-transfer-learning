# IDS-using-transfer-learning
## 📋 Overview

A resource-efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed specifically for IoT environments using transfer learning. This system achieves **99.5% accuracy** with only **33,762 parameters**, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices.

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid 1D-CNN + BiLSTM architecture for spatial-temporal feature extraction
- Transfer learning from CIC-IDS 2017 to IoT-specific datasets
- Lightweight design optimized for low-power IoT devices
- High detection accuracy for DDoS and botnet attacks
